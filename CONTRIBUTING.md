# How to contribute

To contribute, just follow these steps:

1. Fork this repo
2. Create a new branch (name it according to what functionality you are adding)
3. Add, edit, or re-organize Code Snippets by editing folders and files and commiting them to your forked repository
4. Submit a pull request`
  - Pull requests should have a title/comment that describes what is being added/changed
  - Pull requests should only contain files that are relevant to what is said in the pull request's title

That's it! A developer advocate or an sndevs designated approver will review your pull request and if approved, merge it into this repo for everyone's benefit!

**Note on multiple submissions**: If you plan on doing another pull request and your original pull request hasn't been approved+merged yet, make sure to create a new branch in your forked repo first.
